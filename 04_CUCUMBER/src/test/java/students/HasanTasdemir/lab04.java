    Page Object Model consist of different packages such as Pages, Steps, Utils  and Runner.
    Pages package helps us to store and reuse all the web elements and methods that
    we need to execute all test cases related with that Page.
    Steps package is to keep our step definitions and snippet codes.
    Utils package stores some classes (driver, configuration reader ect.)
    need to be executed before starting to execute our test cases.
    Runner package contains our test runner class which helps us to start run our testcases.
    It provides us to run similar kind of test cases simultaneously as a group run with a detailed testing report in html and json format.
