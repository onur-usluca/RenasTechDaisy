    /*Page Object Model is a design pattern to create an Object Repository for Web UI Elements.
    For each page in the application, there should be a corresponding page class.
    This page class will find the WebElements of that web page and
    also contains Page Methods which perform operations on those Web Elements.
    Name of these methods should be givrn as per task that they are performing.
    For example, if loader is waiting for payment gateway to appear, POM method can be
    waitForPaymentScreenDisplay();
