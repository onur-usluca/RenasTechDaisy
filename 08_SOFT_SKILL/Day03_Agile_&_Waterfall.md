# The List of SDLC models

The list of SDLC models which have gained popularity and accepted industry-wide throughout the years.

- Spiral Model
- V Model
- Waterfall Methodology
- Agile Model

##The List of SDLC Models

- Spiral Model : is an example of iterative development. Risk Handling

- V-Model : Verification and Validation Model.

- Waterfall Methodology : It is very simple but idealistic.

- Agile : is a time-bound, iterative approach to software delivery
that builds software incrementally from the start of the project,
instead of trying to deliver all at once.


## Agile :

Comprehensive and holistic view towards the implementation of a project.

Able to move quickly and easily.

Agile is a software development methodology.

## Waterfall: 

Smooth segregation of a project into useful parts for better results.


## Agile is a Software Development Methodology

People work together as one team

More human communication, and face-to-face interaction

Continuous feedback from users

Visibility of progress and transparency of process

Shorter development cycles, and more frequent deployment


## Agile Methodology 12 Principles/Rules

### 1) Satisfy the customer
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

### 2) Welcome change
- In the world around us, change is the only constant. Agile principles and values support responding
  to these changes rather than moving forward in spite of them.

### 3) Deliver frequently
- Agile philosophy favors breaking a product’s development into smaller components and “shipping” those components frequently. Using an agile approach, therefore — and building in more frequent mini-releases
  of your product— can speed the product’s overall development.

### 4) Work together
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.


### 5) Trust and support
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need,
  and trust them to get the job done.

### 6) Face to face conversation
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development
  team is face-to-face conversation.

### 7) Working software
- Working software is the primary measure of progress. Ship software often: a useful product now is
  better than a perfect one later.

### 8) Sustainable development
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be
  able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

### 9) Continuous attention
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

### 10) Maintain simplicity
- Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.

### 11) Self-organizing teams
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

### 12) Reflect and adjust
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and
  adjusts its behavior accordingly.
