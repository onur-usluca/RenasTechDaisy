# Scrum vs Kanban

Scrum is 
- concerned about iterations
- good for progress and planning
- used for the feature driven tasks with mapped out goals


Kanban is

- about work state
- good for flow and throughput
- used for incoming small pieces of work, such as defect fixes or small enhancement requests  


## Kanban

- Kanban is Japanese word Means : Signboard

- One of the Agile framework

- It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work.
- Work items are represented visually on a Kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time

## Kanban 3 Rules :

1. Visualize work flow (Kanban Board)

2. Limit WIP

3. Manage Flow


## Visualize The Flow Of Work

This is the fundamental first step to adopting and implementing the Kanban Method. You need to
visualize – either on a physical board or an electronic Kanban Board, the process steps that you currently
use to deliver your work or your services.


## Limit WIP (Work in Progress)

- Limiting work-in-progress (WIP) is fundamental to implementing Kanban – a ‘Pull-system’.


- By limiting WIP, you encourage your team to complete work at hand first before taking up new work.


- WIP is the number of task items that a team is currently working on.

## Manage Flow

Managing flow is a principle of Kanban and is about shifting the focus from the people to the work.

So instead of managing people and keeping them busy all the time, we focus on managing the work and
understanding how we get that work through the system faster.


## Benefits Of Kanban

1) Flexibility.

2) Focus on continuous delivery.

3) Reduction of wasted work / wasted time.

4) Increased productivity.

5) Increased efficiency.

6) Team members' ability to focus.


## Similarities Between Kanban and Scrum

- Pull System(Based on customer demand)

- Both limits work in progress (WIP)

- Both breaks down complex Tasks

- High value on continual improvement


## Scrum vs Kanban

Scrum has sprints. (Duration of time box up to one month)

Kanban has no required time box or iterations It has continuous delivery. (Flexible)

Scrum has a set of mandatory roles that you must implement.

Under Kanban, no set roles are prescribed. No assigned Kanban master. This can
be overwhelming

Commitment or the capacity is assigned based on previous sprint. This can fail due
to unplanned work or not committing to capacity

The commitment is based on capacity. They only take next task if previous one is
completed


Planning happens iteratively at the beginning of each sprint

In Kanban, there is almost zero planning. Instead there is just in time delivery(JIT)
instead of big planning

Both limits work in progress(WIP) but in different ways. Scrum limits with
iterations, which means you can start from any task assigned to you.

In Kanban, you cannot go to next item unless you finished the current one that is
assigned to you.

In scrum , change of requirements during the sprint is discouraged, but with
Kanban it is more flexible
