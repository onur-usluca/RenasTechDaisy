##What is scrum?

“_A framework within which people can address complex adaptive
problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the
highest possible value._” (Edureka.com)

With scrum you can:

- Write fewer plans and do more in short iterations or cycles that we call sprints

- Work as one dedicated and committed team, instead of working on separate groups

- Constantly deliver functioning products at the end of each sprint

- Receive continuous feedback from your customers and improvise your product


## Agile-Scrum

- **Scrum** is an **Agile process** that allows us to focus on delivering the
highest business value in the shortest time.

- **Scrum** uses Iterative process.

- The **business sets the priorities**. Team self organize to determine the
best way to deliver the highest priority features.

## Advantage of Using Scrum framework

- Scrum framework is fast moving and money efficient.

- Scrum is adaptive in nature because it have short sprint.

- In Scrum customer satisfaction is very important.


## Disadvantage of Using Scrum Framework

- Daily meetings sometimes frustrate team members

- Adopting the Scrum framework in large teams is challenging

- The chances of project failure are high if individuals aren't very committed or cooperative

## People & Parts of Scrum Framework

The Scrum Framework is made of three distinct categories, which are:

- **Scrum Roles**
- **Events in Scrum**.
- **Scrum Artifacts**


## Scrum Team:

- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team

## Scrum Team - Product Owner

- The Product Owner is a central role within the Scrum Framework

- He represents the end customer or stakeholders.

- Defines the product in the customer-focused terminology (typically user stories)

- Adds them to the product backlog

- Prioritizes them based on importance and dependencies
- Decides on release date and content

- Accept or reject work results

- Responsible for the profitability of the product (ROI)

- Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to
all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next


## Scrum team - Scrum Master

- A Scrum Master helps the scrum team perform at their highest level.

- Helps the PO maintain the product backlog.

- Coaching the team, within the Scrum principles.

- Organizes the work of the team and provides it with everything necessary

- Scrum Master is there to serve team, he or she has no
authority over the team

- Ensure that the team is fully functional and productive

- Represents management to the project

## Scrum Team - Development Team

- A Development team is a group of individuals like developers, testers, etc. who work
together to deliver the requested and committed products

- The Development Team builds the product that the Product Owner indicates: the application or website

- The Development Team is a cross-functional, small and self-organizing team which
owns the collective responsibility of developing, testing and releasing the Product
increment.


## Events in Scrum AKA Scrum Ceremonies
 
The 5 Scrum Ceremonies:

1) Sprint Planning
2) Daily Scrum
3) Sprint Preview
4) Sprint Retro
5) Backlog Refinement

## Sprint Planning

- **Sprint Planning**: Sprint planning is an event in the Scrum framework where the
team determines the product backlog items, they will work on during
that sprint and discusses their initial plan for completing those product backlog
items.

- It is conducted on the first day of a new sprint

- Who is involved in Sprint Planning?

- Sprint planning typically involves the entire team.

- Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team

## Daily Scrum/Stand up

- Daily Scrum: Also known as a stand-up, it is
a 15-minute daily meeting where the team has a
chance to get on the same page and put together
a strategy for the next 24 hours.

## Sprint Review/Demo

During the sprint review, product owner explains what the planned work was and what was not completed during the Sprint. The team then presents completed work and discuss what went well and how
problems were solved.

## Sprint Grooming(Optional)

During a sprint grooming or sprint planning session, the product team
reviews the backlog items and decides on the number of items to be
developed during the next sprint, based on team capacity

## Sprint Retrospective/Sprint Retro

**Sprint Retrospective**: During sprint retrospective, the team discusses what
went right, what went wrong, and how to improve. They decide on how
to fix the problems and create a plan for improvements to be enacted
during the next sprint.

## Scrum Artifacts
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Increment
- Sprint Burn-Down Chart

## Product Backlog

- The Product Backlog is an ordered list of features that are needed as part of the end
product and it is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the



- The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes
that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases.


- Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the
Product Owner’s discretion.


## Sprint Backlog

- The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint,
plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.


- The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Team about what functionality will be
made available in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that
functionality as a working product Increment.


## Increment

- The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed
during a Sprint combined with the increments of all previous Sprints.


- Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint.


- Any one product should have a definition of Increment that is a standard for any work done on it.

## Sprint Burn-Down Chart

- Sprint Burn-Down Chart is a practice for trending the work
expended by the Scrum Team.


- At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the
Sprint Backlog can be summed.
